# DestT5 (Correcting Semantic Parses with Natural Language through Dynamic Schema Encoding)
Dataset for DestT5 (NLP for ConvAI, ACL 2023)

![Model Diagram](./img/model_diagram.png)

Contains 112 annotations for interactive semantic parsing.

Given randomly selected errors on the [Spider](https://github.com/taoyds/spider) dataset by [tscholak/3vnuv1vf](https://huggingface.co/tscholak/3vnuv1vf), natural language feedback is given to correct the erroneous parse.
